#What is SSoC ?
It is a program initiated by SefrWahed'16 for the purposes of:
    - simulating GSoC and teaching students the necessary technical and non technical skills to be able to participate.
    - expanding college projects into useful daily used projects instead of being just delivered and thrown away
    - spreading open source culture in students community

SefrWahed is a student activity in Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Egypt. that is concerned with Computer Engineering Fields and aims to build a community of developpers and learners of shared technical interests.
